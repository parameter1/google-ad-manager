Test networks are limited in the following ways:  Test networks cannot serve ads. Because test networks cannot serve ads, reports will always come back without data. Since forecasting requires serving history, forecast service results will be faked. See ForecastService for more info. Test networks are, by default, Ad Manager networks and don't have any features from Ad Manager 360. To have additional features turned on, please contact your account manager.
