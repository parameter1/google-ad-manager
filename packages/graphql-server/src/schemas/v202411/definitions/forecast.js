From least to most, these are:  Available units -- How many units can be booked without affecting any other line items. Booking more than this number can cause lower and same priority line items to underdeliver. Possible units -- How many units can be booked without affecting any higher priority line items. Booking more than this number can cause the line item to underdeliver. Matched (forecast) units -- How many units satisfy all specified criteria.  Underdelivery is caused by overbooking. However, if more impressions are served than are predicted, the extra available inventory might enable all inventory guarantees to be met without overbooking."
